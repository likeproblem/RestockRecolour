**MOVED TO [WIKI](https://github.com/likeproblem/RestockRecolour/wiki/Part-List)**

# HOW TO INSTALL
Download source, grab inside TURD(without license or readme, 1 folder), and put into GameData(merge with TURD!)

# Honorable Mentions:
* @UncleMateo, @Spartwo, and @EmberSkyMedia for contribution
* OrbitalPhoenix, for inspiring to do the same thing, and ~~stolen~~ inspired mk1-3pod design
* ZZetho for creating amazing tutorial
* And of course TURD, TU and Restock
* (pss, and my config maker too, very handy)

# Known Issues:
* Some stuff doesn't like switching meshes properly, so after you switch variants you have to switch to Default and Paint again
* Just a silly issue, some parts such as TURD's jet engines and intakes, and radial science module, will appear transparent, however after you launch vessel return to VAB it will fix itself
* Mk1-2 pod can't color top hatch for some reason
