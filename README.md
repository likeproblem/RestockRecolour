**MOVED TO [WIKI](https://github.com/likeproblem/RestockRecolour/wiki/Part-List)**

# HOW TO INSTALL
Download source, grab inside TURD(without license or readme, 1 folder), and put into GameData(merge with TURD!)

# Honorable Mentions:
* @UncleMateo, @Spartwo, and @EmberSkyMedia for contribution
* OrbitalPhoenix, for inspiring to do the same thing, and ~~stolen~~ inspired mk1-3pod design
* ZZetho for creating amazing tutorial
* And of course TURD, TU and Restock
* (pss, and my config maker too, very handy)

# Known Issues:
* Some stuff doesn't like switching meshes properly, for now only engine plate's fairing and HG-55 axial/radial, so after you switch it you have to switch to Default and Paint again
* Just a silly issue, some parts such as TURD's jet engines and intakes, and radial science module, will appear transparent, however after you launch vessel return to VAB it will fix itself
* Mk1-2 pod can't color top hatch for some reason

* 5m Separator and Shielded Docking Port look ugly and it is easily fixable, but Restock doesn't allow it due to copyright, but fix could be done when feature comes from TU's side
